### generator-appverse-html5 

This is a Yeoman Generator for Appverse - HTML5

Requirements
-------------
**Nodejs** and **NPM** package manager must be installed.

* Install **bower** and **grunt-cli**.

```bash
    $ npm install -g bower grunt-cli
```
 
* Install **yeoman** if it is not installed previously.

```bash
    $ npm install -g yo
```

Installing 
-------------

* Install the Appverse HTML5 generator NPM package. 

```bash
    $ npm install -g generator-appverse-html5
```

Running 
-------------

* Create a new project using the **generator-appverse-html5**

Create a directoy:

```bash
    $ mkdir testApp
```

```bash
    $ cd testApp
```
Execute the generator:

```bash
    $ yo appverse-html5
```

Yeoman will generate a boilerplate project with **Appverse - HTML5**. 
Execute grunt to test it:

```bash
    $ grunt server
```
or

```bash
    $ grunt server:open 
```

to auto open your default browser with the application.

#### From sources
* Get sources from [GitHub](https://github.com/appverse/generator-appverse-html5)

* Link the package 

```bash
    $ npm link
```

That will create a symlink to your npm cache. 
Now you can execute the generator:

```bash
    $ yo appverse-html5
```

### Sub-generators
------------------
Later on you can add any of the Appverse modules to your project running the subgenerators.

* REST 
Add the Appverse REST module to the project. 
It can add a MOCK REST Server ([json-server](https://github.com/typicode/json-server))

```bash
    $ yo appverse-html5:rest
```

Mock server adds two new grunt tasks:

```bash
    $ grunt mockserver
```

Runs the application using the mock JSON server as REST backend, and:

```bash
    $ grunt mockserver:open
```

Runs the application using the mock JSON server as REST backend and open the default browser.


* Cache   

```bash
    $ yo appverse-html5:cache 
```

* Detection  

```bash
    $ yo appverse-html5:detection 
```

* Performance

```bash
    $ yo appverse-html5:performance    
```
* Logging   

```bash 
    $ yo appverse-html5:logging 
```

* Server Push 

```bash 
    $ yo appverse-html5:serverpush    
```

* Translation  

```bash 
    $ yo appverse-html5:translate
```

* Security  

```bash 
    $ yo appverse-html5:security
```

* QR  

```bash
    $ yo appverse-html5:qr
```

* Add a new view  
Execute the app-view subgenerator with the view name as argument. The subgenerator will create the HTML view and the JS controller. 
A new option in the navigation bar will be created as well. 

```bash
    $ yo appverse-html5:app-view $viewname
```

The second argument will used to add the option to a dropdown menu in the navigation bar. If the dropdown menu already exists, the new option will be added, if not exists it will be created.

```bash
    $ yo appverse-html5:app-view $viewname $dropdownmenu
```

* Add a new REST entity  
The subgenerator will require REST module installed. 

It will create:
  * A view to manage the Rest entity
  * A controller for the view
  * A MOCK JSON file if the MOCK REST server was selected.
  * A new option in the navigation bar.

```bash
    $ yo appverse-html5:rest-entity $entityname
```

The second argument will add or update a dropdown menu.

```bash
    $ yo appverse-html5:rest-entity $entityname $dropdownmenu
```


* Node-Webkit 
Add Node-Webkit support to the project.

```bash
    $ yo appverse-html5:webkit
```

Package your application with Grunt as an executable file. 

```bash
    $ grunt nodewebkit:dist
``` 

Start your application using the Node-Webkit browser

```bash
    $ npm start 
```

* Mobile
Add Mobile builds to your project with grunt.
   * Configure your build server and credentials. 
   
```bash
    $ yo appverse-html5:mobile
```

Execute: 

```bash
    $ grunt dist:mobile
``` 

The **grunt taks** will:
  * Create your mobile bundle
  * Upload the result to the build server
  * Download the package from the build server for each plattform. (Android, iOS or Windows Phone)
  

### Bootstrap theme selector 
The Appverse HTML5 generator allows to select a bootstrap theme from [Bootswatch](http://bootswatch.com) using the [Bootswatch API](https://bootswatch.com/help/)

* The Appverse HTML5 generator will connect to bootswatch to get the available themes list. 
* It will apply the selected Bootswatch theme to the generated project.

#### Subgenerator
* Bootstrap theme selector from [Bootswatch](http://bootswatch.com)

```bash
    $ yo appverse-html5:bootstrap-theme    
```

### Arguments and options

It's possible to call the gerenetor using arguments and skipping prompts.

* The first argument is the application name. 

```bash
    $ yo appverse-html5 myWeb
```

### Project JSON - Schema 
It's possible to call the gerenetor using a JSON defition as argument. That will skip prompting by the generator. 
The JSON could be a file or URL. 

```bash
    $ yo appverse-html5 --project=myProject.json 
```

The JSON definition must be a valid definition.
The generator will perform a JSON validation using the [appverse-html5 project definition JSON schema](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Appverse/generator-appverse-html5/master/app/schema/appverse-project-schema.json)

####Example 
This is an example of JSON a project file, selecting all the avaliable options for the generator. 

```json
{
    "project": "myTestProject",
    "components": {
        "serverpush": {
            "enabled": true,
            "config": {
                "serverURL": "127.0.0.1"
            }
        },
        "rest": {
            "enabled": true,
            "config": {
                "backend": {
                    "host": "mybackendhost",
                    "port": 8080
                },
                "mock": {
                    "host": "127.0.0.1",
                    "port": 9888
                }
            }
        },
        "cache": {
            "enabled": true
        },
        "logging": {
            "enabled": true
        },
        "performance": {
            "enabled": true
        },
        "detection": {
            "enabled": true
        },
        "qr": {
            "enabled": true
        },
        "translate": {
            "enabled": true
        },
        "security": {
            "enabled": true
        }
    },
    "theme": {
        "enabled": true,
        "config": {
            "scss": "http://bootswatch.com/cerulean/_bootswatch.scss",
            "scssVariables": "http://bootswatch.com/cerulean/_variables.scss"
        }
    },
    "build": {
        "imagemin": {
            "enabled": true
        }
    },
    "package": {
        "webkit": {
            "enabled": true
        },
        "mobile": {
            "enabled": true,
            "config": {
                "builder": {
                    "hostname": "http://hostname",
                    "username": "username",
                    "password": "password"
                }
            }
        }
    }
}

```



#### Skip install
Add the skip-install argument to skip npm and bower install process. 

```bash
    $ yo appverse-html5 --skip-install  
```

```bash
    $ yo appverse-html5 --project=myProject.json --skip-install  
```

```bash
    $ yo appverse-html5 myWeb --skip-install    
```

The generator will execute 'grunt list' tasks when finish to report all the available grunt tasks into the README.md of the generated project. 
If --skip-install was used, 'grunt list' wont be executed, as it needs node_modules. 

```bash
    $ npm install 
```

```bash
    $ grunt list
```
