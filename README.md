### generator-appverse-html5 

This is a Yeoman Generator for Appverse - HTML5
 
* Install yeoman if it is not installed previously.

```bash
npm install -g yo
```

* Install the Appverse HTML5 generator NPM package. 

```bash
npm install -g generator-appverse-html5
```

* Create a new project using the generator-appverse-html5

```bash
mkdir testApp
```

```bash
cd testApp
```

```bash
yo appverse-html5
```

Yeoman will generate a boilerplate project with Appverse - HTML5. 
Execute grunt to test it:

```bash
grunt server
```

#### From sources
* Get sources from [GitHub](https://github.com/appverse/generator-appverse-html5)

* Link the package 

```bash
npm link
```

That will create a symlink to your npm cache. 
Now you can execute the generator:

```bash
yo appverse-html5
```

### Sub-generators

* REST 

```bash
yo appverse-html5:rest
```

* Cache   

```bash
yo appverse-html5:cache 
```

* Detection  

```bash
yo appverse-html5:detection 
```

* Performance

```
* Logging   

```bash

```

* Server Push

yo appverse-html5:security
```

* QR  

```bash

```

* Add a new view  

```bash
yo appverse-html5:app-view
```

### Bootstrap theme selector 
The Appverse HTML5 generator allows to select a bootstrap theme from [Bootswatch](http://bootswatch.com) using the [Bootswatch API](https://bootswatch.com/help/)

* The Appverse HTML5 generator will connect to bootswatch to get the available themes list. 
* It will apply the selected Bootswatch theme to the generated project.

#### Subgenerator
* Bootstrap theme selector from bootswatch.com

```bash
yo appverse-html5:bootstrap-theme
```

### Arguments and options

It's possible to call the gerenetor using arguments and skipping prompts.

* The first argument is the application name. 

```bash
yo appverse-html5 myWeb
```

* Sub-generator are optional arguments 

```bash
yo appverse-html5 myWeb --cache --rest
```

or 

```bash
yo appverse-html5 --cache --rest
```

and the name will be set by default with the current folder name. 

* Generate the project calling all sub-generators.

```bash
yo appverse-html5 myWeb --all
```

#### Skip install
Add the skip-install argument to skip npm and bower install process. 

```bash
yo appverse-html5 myWeb --skip-install
```

## Getting Started

### What is Yeoman?

Trick question. It's not a thing. It's this guy:

![](http://i.imgur.com/JHaAlBJ.png)

Basically, he wears a top hat, lives in your computer, and waits for you to tell him what kind of application you wish to create.

Not every new computer comes with a Yeoman pre-installed. He lives in the [npm](https://npmjs.org) package repository. You only have to ask for him once, then he packs up and moves into your hard drive. *Make sure you clean up, he likes new and shiny things.*

```bash
npm install -g yo
```

### Yeoman Generators

Yeoman travels light. He didn't pack any generators when he moved in. You can think of a generator like a plug-in. You get to choose what type of application you wish to create, such as a Backbone application or even a Chrome extension.

To install generator-appverse-html5 from npm, run:

```bash
npm install -g generator-appverse-html5
```

Finally, initiate the generator:

```bash
yo appverse-html5
```

### Getting To Know Yeoman

Yeoman has a heart of gold. He's a person with feelings and opinions, but he's very easy to work with. If you think he's too opinionated, he can be easily convinced.

If you'd like to get to know Yeoman better and meet some of his friends, [Grunt](http://gruntjs.com) and [Bower](http://bower.io), check out the complete [Getting Started Guide](https://github.com/yeoman/yeoman/wiki/Getting-Started).
